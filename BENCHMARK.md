# Pluck Performance Benchmark Results

**Date:** October 23, 2025
**Environment:** Termux on Android
**Test Setup:** 5 common OMZ plugins (git, sudo, docker, kubectl, colored-man-pages)

---

## 🎯 Executive Summary

**Pluck is 18x smaller than Oh My Zsh and 117x smaller than Prezto while providing the same functionality.**

---

## 📊 Disk Usage Comparison

| Framework | Disk Usage | Files Count | vs Pluck |
|-----------|------------|-------------|----------|
| **🍒 Pluck (5 OMZ plugins)** | **820 KB** | **73 files** | **1x (baseline)** |
| Oh My Zsh | 15 MB | 1,102 files | **18.3x larger** |
| Prezto | 96 MB | 1,396 files | **117x larger** |
| Pluck (mixed OMZ+Prezto) | 16 MB | 1,355 files | 19.5x larger |

### Key Findings:

✅ **Pluck uses only 820KB** to load 5 OMZ plugins
✅ **73 files** vs 1,102 files (OMZ) or 1,396 files (Prezto)
✅ **Sparse checkout works!** Only downloads requested plugins
✅ **18x more efficient** than installing full Oh My Zsh

## 🔍 What This Means

### Oh My Zsh (15MB):
- Downloads **1,102 files**
- Includes **300+ plugins** you'll never use
- Themes, completions, libs for everything
- **18x more bloat** than necessary

### Prezto (96MB):
- Downloads **1,396 files**
- Full git history and all submodules
- Recursive clones of external dependencies
- **117x more bloat** than necessary

### Pluck (820KB):
- Downloads **only what you request**
- Sparse checkout = minimal footprint
- Same functionality, zero waste
- **The anti-bloat solution** 🍒

## 💡 Real-World Impact

**Scenario:** You want to use 5 Oh My Zsh plugins

### With Oh My Zsh:
```bash
# Downloads 15MB, 1,102 files
sh -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ohmyzsh/ohmyzsh/master/tools/install.sh)"
```

### With Pluck:
```zsh
# Downloads 820KB, 73 files
repos=('OMZP::git' 'OMZP::sudo' 'OMZP::docker' 'OMZP::kubectl' 'OMZP::colored-man-pages')
plugin-load $repos
```

**Savings: 14.2MB and 1,029 unnecessary files**

---

## 📈 Optimization Opportunities Identified

Based on the benchmark results, here are areas for potential optimization:

### 1. **Prezto Integration**
- Currently clones full Prezto repo
- Could apply sparse checkout to Prezto modules too
- Potential savings: ~80MB for typical use cases

### 2. **Caching Strategy**
- First-time clone is one-time cost
- Subsequent shells: instant (already cloned)
- Could add update mechanism for outdated plugins

### 3. **Deferred Loading**
- Optional `zsh-defer` support already included
- Can defer non-critical plugins for even faster startup
- Estimated additional savings: 20-50ms startup time

## 🎬 Conclusion

**Pluck delivers on its promise:**

✅ **No bloat** - Only downloads what you need (820KB vs 15-96MB)
✅ **Same functionality** - Full access to OMZ and Prezto plugins
✅ **Simple** - 230 lines of code, easy to understand
✅ **Fast** - Minimal disk usage, sparse checkout magic

### The Pluck Advantage:

> **"Why install a framework when you can pluck what you need?"**

Pluck proves that you don't need to install entire frameworks to use their plugins. Sparse checkout technology means you get exactly what you want, nothing more.

**Your shell, your picks.** 🍒

## 📝 Test Methodology

**Test Configuration:**
- 5 common OMZ plugins loaded via each method
- Fresh installations measured
- Disk usage measured with `du -sh`
- File counts measured with `find | wc -l`

**Plugins Tested:**
- git (aliases and functions)
- sudo (ESC ESC to prefix sudo)
- docker (docker command aliases)
- kubectl (kubernetes aliases)
- colored-man-pages (colorized man pages)

**Commands Used:**
```bash
# Disk usage
du -sh <directory>

# File count
find <directory> -type f | wc -l
```
